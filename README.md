# Dynamic To-Do List Application

This is a dynamic To-Do List application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application allows users to add, manage, and filter tasks. It also integrates with the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/todos#todos-a) for task management and persists the tasks in local storage.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete/Incomplete**: Users can toggle the completion status of a task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks by:
  - All tasks
  - Completed tasks
  - Pending tasks
- **API Integration**: Tasks are fetched from the DummyJSON API.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Tasks are saved in local storage to persist after a page refresh.
  
## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building UI components and managing state.
- **Vite**: For a fast and modern development environment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
- **DummyJSON API**: To simulate API operations like adding, updating, and deleting todos.
- **Local Storage**: For persisting tasks across page reloads.
